Game name: Astros Adventure


Abstract: Our team created a game called Astros Adventure which is based in space and is about an astronaut, who has to go to 3 levels in order to complete the game. All three levels have a different objective. The first level is about a maze in which the astronaut has to collect a key which will open doors and then the astronaut has to go to a portal which will take him to the second level. In the second level, the astronaut has to dodge multiple moving aliens, which move in a single line but each alien moves at a different speed, In order to collect a key which again will give access to another portal which will take him to level three. In the third level the astronaut is being followed by an evil which he has to dodge and collect multiple gems before the evil catches him. As soon as the gems are collected the game will end.
